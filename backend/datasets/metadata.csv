It is a spatially gridded (5° - 5°) global surface temperature dataset, with monthly resolution from January 1850 to present. We combine a global sea surface (water) temperature (SST) dataset with a global land surface air temperature datasets. The SST dataset is the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) version 5. The land surface air temperature dataset is similar to ERSST but uses data from the Global Historical Climatology Network Monthly (GHCNm) database, version 4. Also used are ICOADS and IABD data. We provide the NOAAGlobalTemp dataset as temperature anomalies, relative to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology, following the World Meteorological Organization convention. This is the dataset NOAA uses for global temperature monitoring."

Production of the ERSST is on a 2° - 2° grid with spatial completeness enhanced using statistical methods. This monthly analysis begins in January 1854 continuing to the present and includes anomalies computed with respect to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology. The newest version of ERSST, version 5, uses new data sets from ICOADS Release 3.0 (Sea Surface Temperatures) SST; SST comes from Argo floats above 5 meters, Hadley Centre Ice-SST version 2 (HadISST2) ice concentration. ERSSTv5 has improved SST spatial and temporal variability by (a) reducing spatial filtering in training the reconstruction functions Empirical Orthogonal Teleconnections (EOTs), (b) removing high-latitude damping in EOTs, and (c) adding 10 more EOTs in the Arctic. ERSSTv5 improved absolute SST by switching from using Nighttime Marine Air Temperature (NMAT) as a reference to buoy-SST as a reference in correcting ship SST biases. Scientists have further improved ERSSTv5 by using unadjusted First-Guess instead of adjusted First-Guess."

Data from rain gauge stations, satellites, and sounding observations have been merged to estimate monthly rainfall on a 2.5-degree global grid from 1979 to the present. The careful combination of satellite-based rainfall estimates provides the most complete analysis of rainfall available to date over the global oceans, and adds necessary spatial detail to the rainfall analyses over land. In addition to the combination of these data sets, estimates of the uncertainties in the rainfall analysis are provided as a part of the GPCP products."

Surface pressure data are drawn from the International Surface Pressure Databank (ISPD v4.7) through international collaboration coordinated by the ACRE initiative and global climate research programs. 20CRv3 assimilates surface pressure observations using an ensemble Kalman filter with a four-dimensional incremental analysis update and is driven by prescribed sea surface temperature and sea ice boundary conditions derived primarily from HadISST datasets. The system employs the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS v14.0.1) coupled with land surface and thermodynamic sea ice models, operating at approximately 75 km horizontal resolution with 64 vertical levels and 80 ensemble members. Spanning the mid-19th century to the present, 20CRv3 provides a physically consistent framework for studying long-term climate variability, extreme events, and atmospheric circulation changes across the historical record."

It is used for monitoring, retrospective analysis as well as for providing oceanic initial conditions for the CFS. Both temperature and synthetic salinity profiles are assimilated in a 3DVAR scheme designed by Derber and Rosati (1989). 40 vertical levels are in the model together with 1x1 data values (enhanced in resolution to 1/3x1/3 degrees latitude within 10 degrees of the equator). The data is provided at 1/3x1/3 degrees for all latitudes. The GODAS is forced by the momentum flux, heat flux and fresh water flux from the NCEP atmospheric Reanalysis 2. It appears to reproduce observations quite well (see the references)."

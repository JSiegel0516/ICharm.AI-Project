# iCharmFastAPI Service

This document describes how the dataset FastAPI service fits into the project, how it discovers climate datasets, and how the CMORPH timeseries feature reaches the frontend.

## Architecture Overview

- **Location**: `services/data-api/app/iCharmFastAPI.py` exposes a FastAPI application that is built into the `data-api` container.
- **Purpose**: Provide a uniform JSON interface for climate datasets defined in `metadata.csv` (local bundles or remote S3 resources). It powers both the mock data used across the UI and dynamic timeseries requests.
- **Metadata driven**: Every request reads from `metadata.csv` to locate the dataset, discover variables, units, available levels, and paths.
- **Shared helpers**: Functions such as `load_metadata`, `choose_best_variable`, `load_dataset`, `is_multilevel`, and `select_time_safe` encapsulate most of the common logic.

## Metadata Flow

1. **`metadata.csv`** lives in the repo root. It is bind-mounted into the container at `/app/metadata.csv` and `/app/data/metadata.csv`.
2. `load_metadata` reads the file on every request (data is small), guaranteeing the API always reflects the current CSV.
3. Each row contains keys like `datasetName`, `Stored` (`local` or `cloud`), `inputFile`, `keyVariable`, `engine`, and optional `kerchunkPath`.
4. Dataset discovery works as follows:
   - If `Stored` is `local`, `inputFile` is treated as a path inside the container volume (supports NetCDF and Zarr).
   - If `Stored` is `cloud`, the API expects an S3 template. `load_dataset` handles S3 access through `s3fs`, applying the `{year}` / `{month}` / `{day}` placeholders when needed.
   - For templated NetCDF directories, the service builds the S3 glob pattern and opens a multi-file dataset with `xarray.open_mfdataset`.

## Core Utility Functions

| Function | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `load_metadata` | Read and validate the CSV; raises if missing or malformed. |
| `iso_times_from_coord` | Normalize time coordinates (xarray, numpy, pandas, or cftime) to ISO strings. |
| `choose_best_variable` | Heuristic that favours anomaly, temperature, precipitation or wind variables when a user does not specify one. |
| `is_multilevel` | Detects whether a dataset has vertical levels (`level`, `plev`). |
| `select_time_safe` | Select the nearest timestep; falls back to the first record if parsing fails. |
| `load_dataset` | Open a dataset (local or S3) and return an `xarray.DataArray`. This is the gateway used by every endpoint. |

## Standard API Endpoints

These routes are primarily used by the frontend helper scripts and the (future) analysis dashboard.

| Route | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/datasets` | `GET` | Returns an array of dataset rows derived from `metadata.csv`. NaN/Infinity are normalised to `null` before serialization. |
| `/point_timeseries` | `POST` | Body contains `dataset_name`, `lat`, `lon`, optional `variable`, `level`, `year`, `month`, `day`. Returns a time-ordered series of values around the requested location. |
| `/point_statistics` | `POST` | Same payload as above, but returns descriptive statistics (min, max, quartiles, mean, std, variance, skewness, kurtosis). |
| `/monthly_mean_std` | `POST` | Computes monthly mean and std for a specific year. |
| `/monthly_mean_yearly_std` | `POST` | For the requested year, returns the monthly mean plus the standard deviation calculated across all available years. |
| `/seasonal_timeseries` | `POST` | Returns a year-over-year series for a specific month (useful for seasonal comparisons). |

All endpoints normalise infinities to `null` to keep the JSON encoder happy.

## Raster Grids (All Datasets)

The new raster endpoint exposes a consistent grid contract for any dataset flagged with `supportsRaster` in `metadata.csv`.

- **Route**: `POST /datasets/raster`
- **Request body**:
  ```json
  {
    "dataset_name": "Precipitation - CMORPH CDR",
    "year": 2024,
    "month": 7,
    "day": 15,
    "level": 850.0,
    "variable": "cmorph"
  }
  ```
  `year`/`month`/`day` are optional; supply them when the dataset stores data by date. `level` is only required for multi-level products. `variable` can override the default key variable configured in metadata.

- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "dataset": "Precipitation - CMORPH CDR",
    "shape": [720, 1440],
    "lat": [89.875, 89.625, "..."],
    "lon": [0, 0.25, "..."],
    "values": "<base64 float32 payload>",
    "dataEncoding": { "format": "base64", "dtype": "float32" },
    "valueRange": { "min": 0, "max": 80 },
    "actualRange": { "min": 0.015, "max": 67.2 },
    "units": "mm/day",
    "colorMap": "Color Brewer 2.0|Sequential|Multi-hue|9-class YlGnBu",
    "rectangle": { "west": -180, "south": -60, "east": 180, "north": 60 },
    "metadata": {
      "requested": { "year": 2024, "month": 7, "day": 15, "level": null },
      "selection": { "time": "2024-07-15", "level": null },
      "units": "mm/day"
    },
    "supportsRaster": true
  }
  ```

  - `values` is a base64-encoded `Float32Array` laid out row-major (`lat` × `lon`). Missing values remain `NaN`.
  - `lat`/`lon` are sorted ascending; the associated rectangle is already normalised for Cesium's `Rectangle.fromDegrees`.
  - `valueRange` derives from metadata (if present) and falls back to the actual data range for the returned slice.
  - Frontend clients should decode the float array, map values to colours using the requested palette, and treat non-finite numbers as transparent pixels.

## CMORPH Timeseries Endpoint

The notebook `CDR.ipynb` was used as reference in creating a dedicated endpoint for daily precipitation.

- **Route**: `POST /cdr/precip_timeseries`
- **Expected JSON body**:
  ```json
  {
    "dataset_name": "Precipitation - CMORPH CDR", // optional defaults to the CMORPH metadata row
    "year": 2024,
    "month": "01",
    "lat": 32.7,
    "lon": -117.2,
    "comparison_year": 2023,     // optional
    "comparison_month": "01"     // optional
  }
  ```
- **Process**:
  1. `_get_metadata_row` reads the CMORPH entry from `metadata.csv`.
  2. `_cmorph_timeseries` uses `s3fs` + `xarray.open_mfdataset` to open all daily NetCDF files for the requested month. It respects `engine`, `keyVariable`, and handles `s3://` prefixes.
  3. The nearest grid point to the requested lat/lon is selected via `sel(..., method='nearest')` and loaded into memory.
  4. Time/value pairs are converted to JSON, with infinities replaced by `null`.
  5. If `comparison_year` / `comparison_month` are supplied, a second series is included.
- **Response**: JSON payload with `primary.series`, optional `comparison.series`, and metadata about units, requested/nearest coordinates, number of files opened, etc.

### Dependencies

When the container image is built, the following packages enable CMORPH:
- `s3fs` for anonymous S3 access.
- `h5netcdf` so `xarray` can read h5netcdf NetCDF files served by NOAA.
- `dask[array]` (installed as `dask==2024.5.0`) so `open_mfdataset` can operate on the remote tiles.

## Next.js Proxy Route

To avoid CORS and keep secrets server-side, the frontend talks to `/api/cdr/precip-timeseries`:

- File: `src/app/api/cdr/precip-timeseries/route.ts`
- Behaviour: forwards the request body to `${DATA_SERVICE_URL}/cdr/precip_timeseries` and relays the response (status + body) back to the browser.
- No transformation is performed, so the React components receive the backend payload directly.

## Region Info Panel Integration

Within the globe (`src/components/UI/RegionInfoPanel.tsx`):

1. When the user clicks a location, the panel shows precipitation, coordinates, and dataset name with correct units (derived from `currentDataset.units`).
2. Clicking **Time Series** opens a modal. The component:
   - Clamps the requested date to the dataset coverage window (`currentDataset.backend.startDate`/`endDate`).
   - Calls the Next.js proxy endpoint with lat/lon/month/year.
   - Renders the returned series using Recharts. If the dataset isn�t CMORPH, a friendly error explains that timeseries are available for CMORPH only (for now).
3. Loading and error states are surfaced in the modal so users know what happened.

## Local Development & Tips

- Rebuild the dataset container whenever `iCharmFastAPI.py` or its `requirements.txt` change: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up -d --build data-api`.
- Use the `Invoke-WebRequest` snippet below to test the CMORPH endpoint from PowerShell without the UI:
  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST `
    -Uri http://localhost:8002/cdr/precip_timeseries `
    -Body '{"dataset_name":"Precipitation - CMORPH CDR","year":2024,"month":"01","lat":32.7,"lon":-117.2}' `
    -ContentType 'application/json'
  ```
- If you add new datasets to `metadata.csv`, restart the container to ensure the API reads the latest file.

## Troubleshooting

- **404 from `/cdr/precip_timeseries`**: usually means the requested month lies outside the dataset coverage or the metadata path is wrong. Verify start/end dates in `metadata.csv`.
- **`unrecognized engine h5netcdf`**: install `h5netcdf` (already pinned in `services/data-api/requirements.txt`).
- **`unrecognized chunk manager dask`**: ensure `dask[array]` is installed (also pinned now).
- **No timeseries in the modal**: confirm the CMORPH dataset is active and the Next.js dev server has been restarted after adding the proxy route.

A client does not need to download an entire dataset such as 5 gigabytes from climate modeling output to make analysis. Instead, users run 4DVD code on their own computer browsers to visually obtain desired data from optimal routes of database and data server. Users can instantly see data as figures, spatial climate maps, or historical climate time series, and quickly determine if this is their desired climate scenario. Users can then choose to download digital data for further analysis or figure re-plotting.",

NOAA,NOAA Global Surface Temperature Anomalies,,"The NOAA Global Surface Temperature Dataset (NOAAGlobalTemp) is a merged land-ocean surface temperature analysis (formerly known as MLOST). It is a spatially gridded (5° - 5°) global surface temperature dataset, with monthly resolution from January 1850 to present. We combine a global sea surface (water) temperature (SST) dataset with a global land surface air temperature datasets. The SST dataset is the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) version 5. The land surface air temperature dataset is similar to ERSST but uses data from the Global Historical Climatology Network Monthly (GHCNm) database, version 4. Also used are ICOADS and IABD data. We provide the NOAAGlobalTemp dataset as temperature anomalies, relative to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology, following the World Meteorological Organization convention.

NOAA,NOAA Extended Reconstructed SST V5,,"The Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) dataset is a global monthly sea surface temperature dataset derived from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS). Production of the ERSST is on a 2° - 2° grid with spatial completeness enhanced using statistical methods. This monthly analysis begins in January 1854 continuing to the present and includes anomalies computed with respect to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology. The newest version of ERSST, version 5, uses new data sets from ICOADS Release 3.0 (Sea Surface Temperatures) SST; SST comes from Argo floats above 5 meters, Hadley Centre Ice-SST version 2 (HadISST2) ice concentration. ERSSTv5 has improved SST spatial and temporal variability by (a) reducing spatial filtering in training the reconstruction functions Empirical Orthogonal Teleconnections (EOTs), (b) removing high-latitude damping in EOTs, and (c) adding 10 more EOTs in the Arctic. ERSSTv5 improved absolute SST by switching from using Nighttime Marine Air Temperature (NMAT) as a reference to buoy-SST as a reference in correcting ship SST biases.

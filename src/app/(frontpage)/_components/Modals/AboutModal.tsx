                      Welcome to iCharm
                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
                      Everyone talks about global warming or climate change, but
                      few have seen the climate data, because accessing climate
                      data can be a technically challenging task. This
                      4-Dimensional Visual Delivery of Big Climate Data (4DVD)
                      enables anyone to access climate data immediately as long
                      as the person can navigate a website. 4DVD is a unique
                      software developed at the Climate Informatics Lab, San
                      Diego State University, for the instant delivery of big
                      climate data to classrooms and households around the world
                      in a convenient and visual way. It works like an Amazon
                      audio book shopping experience. In fact, at one time 4DVD
                      partnered with Amazon and used Amazon Web Services (AWS),
                      which is a cloud service from Amazon, to store and deliver
                      the climate data. 4DVD makes the climate data acquisition
                      in the same way as one shops on Amazon for digital
                      products, such as digital books or movies. Therefore, the
                      4DVD technology can deliver the climate data instantly to
                      classrooms, museums, and households. Downloading the
                      massive amount of data, making analysis on them, or
                      requesting a server to produce a figure are among the
                      conventional practices of data acquisition in the climate
                      research community. This passive approach is slow and
                      requires climate expertise or professional data analysis
                      training. The powerful 4DVD technology has changed this
                      and enabled an active data acquisition in both visual and
                      digital forms, as if the data are delivered to the user.
                      While DVD plays movies and music, 4DVD (www.4dvd.org) is a
                      website technology that plays big data. Any person who can
                      shop on Amazon can acquire climate data from 4DVD. This
                      convenient climate data technology is achieved because the
                      4DVD big data technology optimizes the resources from
                      database, data server, and the computer browser of a
                      client. A client does not need to download an entire
                      dataset (such as 5 gigabytes data from a climate modeling
                      output) to make analysis of a desired case. Instead, users
                      run the 4DVD code on their own computer browsers to
                      visually obtain the desired data from the optimal routes
                      of database and data server, then can instantly see the
                      data as a figure, a spatial climate map or a historical
                      climate time series, and quickly determine whether this is
                      the desired climate scenario of interest. Eventually, the
                      user can choose to download the digital data for further
                      analysis or figure re-plotting. The original database idea
                      for the 4DVD was from Dr. Julien Pierret around 2010. He
                      began developing the 4DVD technology as part of his PhD
                      research during 2012-2018, directed by Samuel Shen,
                      Distinguished Professor of Mathematics and Statistics, San
                      Diego State University. Shen also developed the framework
                      of the climate data delivery system and coined the term
                      “4DVD” around 2012, when the 4DVD development formally
                      began. The beta-version was available in 2016 for
                      demonstrations. The first public demonstration was made at
                      the NOAA National Environmental Information, Asheville,
                      North Carolina, in March 2016. A paper on the 4DVD
                      technology was first published in 2017 (Pierret and Shen
                      2017). Since then, many students, researchers, and
                      technical personnel have been contributing to the further
                      development of 4DVD, under the leadership of Drs. Pierret
                      and Shen. Users are granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free
